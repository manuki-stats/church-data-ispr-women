Interactive web application displaying data on Institutes and Societies of Pontifical Right for women of the Catholic Church. Source: Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae 2022. 

## Credits
The data presented in this web application was extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by the University Library at the University of Mannheim from the 2022 edition of the Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae. The Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae is compiled annually by the Central Office of Church Statistics of the Holy See's Secretariat of State and published by the Vatican Publishing House.

The data was then transformed and edited by Felicitas HÃ¶rl, student assistant for Prof. Dr. Andreas Wollbold. Additional preprocessing steps and development of the web apps were carried out by Claudia Schiavetti and Manuel Soffici. Claudia Schiavetti and Manuel Soffici worked on the project as Master students in Statistics and Data Science at LMU Munich as part of the Consulting Project module.

The initial idea for the project was developed and supervised by Dr. Anna-Carolina Haensch (Institute of Statistics) and supported by Prof. Dr. Andreas Wollbold and Prof. Dr. Jean-Olivier Nke Ongono (Faculty of Catholic Theology).
